# wider-trello
A simple custom userscript to make the Trello editor more space efficient on big screens

Can be activated in your browser by using an extension like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)

If you don't like the defaults I've set, you can easily edit them at the top of the script.
